The program is a simple Spring Boot application that provides a REST API for managing employees. It uses MySQL as the database, Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database, and Spring Data REST for exposing CRUD operations as RESTful APIs. This application demonstrates the use of Spring Boot's features to create a scalable and maintainable REST API for employee management, including custom query methods for additional functionality.
